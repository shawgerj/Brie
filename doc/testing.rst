Testing is a great way to ensure program robustness, because it converts opinions about how a program works into verifiable facts. Assuming the set of tests is complete, they can also warn developers of regression bugs - the tests can be re-run whenever any changes are made, and failed tests will instantly point to the source of a problem. Lastly, tests provide up-to-date documentation and examples of how to use the application. At this time we test three main areas of ricotta -- API, models, and views. Other tests, such as form tests, maybe be required in the future, but these are workable for now.
